Zachnology Tech Reviews in partnership with 1730 12 is a technology review podcast that I started with Charlie Jacobs in 2020. The podcast covers a wide range of technology topics, including reviews of the latest gadgets, software, and trends in the tech industry. The goal of the podcast is to provide listeners with honest and informative reviews to help them make informed decisions about their technology purchases.

Since its launch, we've released over 25 episodes across 4 seasons, amassing thousands of streams on the various podcast platforms. Zachnology Tech Reviews has been well-received by listeners, and we've received positive feedback on our engaging and informative style. We love to include listener feedback and questions in our episodes in the form of voice messages, which adds an interactive element to the show.

In addition to the podcast itself, we have a dedicated website where listeners can listen to episodes and hold disccusions in the forum. We've released two apps to accompny the podcast: QuickRecord (for Windows and Android), where listeners could quickly record voice messages to send to us, and Zachnology Tech Reviews (for Android), which allows listeners to listen to episodes, send voice messages, receive notifications, and more.

I'm so grateful for the support from our listeners and from Charlie at 1730 12 for the countless hours of work he has put into the podcast. We look forward to continuing to grow the podcast and provide our listeners with the best technology reviews possible.
