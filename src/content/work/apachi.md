I am currently working as a swim instructor and lifeguard during the summers at Apachi Day Camp, which is part of the JCC Chicago. My responsibilities include teaching swimming lessons to children of various ages and skill levels, ensuring their safety in and around the water, and maintaining a positive and engaging environment for campers. I am committed to promoting water safety and helping campers develop their swimming skills.
